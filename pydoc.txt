NAME
    challengeB - # receives a path to the matrix file as an argument and calls Adjacent class

FILE
    /Users/nelsonreverendo/Documents/Mindera/challengeB.py

CLASSES
    Adjacent
    
    class Adjacent
     |  This class receives the path to a file containing a matrix and
     |  outputs the resulting groups of adjacencies in said matrix
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __init__(self, fname)
     |      Method used to initialise attributes and call other necesary methods
     |  
     |  explore_node(self, nx, ny)
     |      Method used to explore recursively a given node in the matrix
     |      
     |      :param nx: node x position (column)
     |      :param ny: node y position (line)
     |  
     |  find_adjacent(self)
     |      Method used to iterate over the matrix nodes
     |      and explore the ones with value equal to 1
     |  
     |  read_from_file(self, filename)
     |      Method used to read a 2D-matrix from a file
     |      
     |      :param filename: path to file
     |      :returns matrix read from file
